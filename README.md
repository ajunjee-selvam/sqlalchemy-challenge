# sqlalchemy-challenge

This repo was created to analyze the climate in Honolulu, Hawaii for trip planning purposes. The climate data is available up until Augut 8, 2017. 

There are 2 parts to this project: 
- Part 1: Use Python and SQLAlchemy for basic climate data analysis and answering quereies
- Part 2: Design a Flask API to answer the same queries as in Part 1

The data used for this analysis can be found in the Resources directory. 

## Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
This section uses SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. 

The following dependencies were needed to execute this section:
- matplotlib
- matplotlib.pyplot 
- numpy 
- pandas 
- datetime
- sqlalchemy

To see the analysis for this section, please open the file called "climate_starter.ipynb".

## Part 2: Design Your Climate App
This section uses Python and the Flask API. 

The following dependencies were needed to execute this section:
- numpy
- pandas
- datetime
- sqlalchemy
- flask

To see the analysis for this section, please open the file called "app.py".
